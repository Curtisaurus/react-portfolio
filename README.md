  ## Description
  A personal developer portfolio developed using React.js as a single-page application.

  ## Installation
  Clone the repo to your local machine and run "npm i" to install all dependencies.

  ## Usage
  It would probably be best to personalize the profile to your needs but it can be run in development mode with "npm start".  Check out the Github pages deployment at [https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages] to customize your deployment.

  ## License
